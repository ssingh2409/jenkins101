Create a new agent 'python-agent'
Steps -
    - Go to Settings -> Nodes
    - Click 'New Node'
    - Provide name - python-agent
    - Check 'Permanent' box
    - Set 'Remote root directory' : /home/jenkins
    - Set 'Launch method' : Launch agent by connecting it to the controller. (This ensures agent runs on the same machine as jenkins MASTER, which for this case is local machine)
    
Docker command -
    docker run -d \
        --name jenkins-python-worker \
        --network jenkins \
        --restart always \
        ssingh2409/jenkins \
        java -jar //usr/share/jenkins/agent.jar \
        -url https://aeronautical-mixed-jamila.ngrok-free.dev/ \
        -secret 8f904d049cf17141f82563a2891c512f1c56cdfdd19aee295f0b8fc694434ad8 \
        -name python-agent \
        -webSocket \
        -noCertificateCheck

    * name : name of the docker container
    * network : ensure master and slave are on the same network
    * ssingh2409/jenkins : python image I bulit to run python commands
    * java -jar : this command ensures that master and slave communicate via webSocket using 8080. If not specified the comms   fallback to socket. Since I used ngrok for proxy, I had to specify the URL for ngrok. (I had to use ngrok as webhooks in Git only work with public URLs)
        * url : ngrok url
        * secret : can be found in jenkins UI
        * name : the exact name as in UI
        * noCertificateCheck : ensures communication can happen over https as well
